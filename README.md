# maze-game

## Description

The game creates a random and solveable n by n maze and takes user input so they can guide a ball through the maze to solve it. The maze generation uses a randomized version of Kruskal's Algorithm and maintains a union-find data structure for connectivity between the nodes (cells) of the maze. The program takes two inputs: the size of the grid, and the difficulty of the maze.

### How to install and run

Download as a zip, open in your IDE of choice, and compile. Takes two command line arguments the first is the size of the grid (n by n) the second is a difficulty between 0-100 with 100 being the hardest.

### Example inputs 
Here is n = 15 and difficulty = 100
