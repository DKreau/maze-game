# maze-game

## Description

The game creates a random and solveable n by n maze and takes user input so they can guide a ball through the maze to solve it. The maze generation uses a randomized version of Kruskal's Algorithm and maintains a union-find data structure for connectivity between the nodes (cells) of the maze. The program takes two inputs: the size of the grid, and the difficulty of the maze.
